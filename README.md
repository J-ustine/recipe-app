# Recipe App

This is a web application where you can search for a recipe by ingredients. You will then be offered a choice of recipe corresponding to your search with photos and title of the recipe.
<br>
You can filter so that you only have vegetarian recipes, quick to prepare or without lactose.
<br>
I also offer a seasonal recipes tab to inspire you with your fresh daily products.
<br>
The styling of the app is inspired by Pinterest.
